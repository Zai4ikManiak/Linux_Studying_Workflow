### What is Shodan?

Shodan is a search engine for Internet-connected devices.

IT gathers information about all devices directly connected to the Internet. If a device is directly hooked up to the Internet then Shodan queries it for various publicly-available information. The types of devices that are indexed can vary tremendously: ranging from small desktops up to nuclear power plants and everything in between.

So what does Shodan index then? The bulk of the data is taken from banners, which are metadata about a software that's running on a device. This can be information about the server software, what options the service supports, a welcome message or anything else that the client would like to know before interacting with the server.

The information gained from these services is applied to many areas:
- **Network Security**:
	>keep an eye on all devices at your company that are facing the Internet.
- **Market Research**:
	>find out which products people are using in the real-world.
- **Cyber Risk**:
	>include the online exposure of your vendors as a risk metric.
- **Internet of Things**:
	>track the growing usage of smart devices.
- **Tracking Ransomware**:
	>measure how many devices have been impacted by ransomware.
