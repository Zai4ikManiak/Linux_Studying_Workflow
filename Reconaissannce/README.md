### What is Reconaissannce / Footprinting ?

> [!NOTE]
> Reconaissannce refers to the preparatory phase where an attacker seeks to *gather as much information as possible about a target of evaluation* prior to launching an attack.

This technique can be categorized into <ins>2 categories</ins>:

- **Passive Footprinting**
	> Gethering information about the target <ins>without direct interaction</ins> with the it.
	- Search Engines
	- Social networking
	- Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering
	- Proprietary database and paid services
	- Sharing intelligence with partner organizations or industry groups.

- **Active Footprinting**
	> Gathering information about the target <ins>with direct interaction</ins> with it.
	> It may requires more preparation than passive footprinting, as it may leave traces that may alert the target organization.
	- DNS interrogation
	- Social networking
	- Network/Port scanning
	- User and services enumeration

A detailed footprinting provides maximal information about the target (placement of firewalls, proxies, and other security solutions), allowing the attacker to identify vulnerabilities in the target system to select appropriate exploits.

### Information Obtained in Footprinting

There are <ins>3 main categories of information obtained</ins> during reconaissannce:

<details>

<summary>Organization Information</summary>

- Employee details (employee names, contact addresses, designations, and work experience).
- Addresses and mobile/telephone numbers.
- Branch and location details.
- Partners of the organization.
- Web links to other company-related sites.
- Background of the organization.
- Web technologies.
- New articles, press releases, and related documents.
- Legal documents related to the organization.
- Patents and trademarks related to the organization.

Attackers can access organizational information and use such information to identify key personnel and launch social engineering attacks to extract sensitive data about the entity.
